                Zerglings form the most numerous of the zerg mutations,â€”their simple DNA (distilled from the dune
                runners' genetic code to its most simple form)
                allows two zerglings to be spawned from a single larva. The larvae get the genetic information from the
                'primordial ooze' of spawning pools.
                Zergling replication is so efficient that they thrive even when exposed to exceedingly high mortality
                rates, which are greater than almost all other zerg strains.
                While their core DNA comes from the dune runner, zerglings are hybridized from over fifteen other
                organism strains.

                SC Ghost Zergling
                A zergling after the Brood War

                Zerglings are the smallest mainline zerg strain apart from the larvae and chitha. Equivalent in
                size to a large dog, zerglings are one meter tall and possess webbed feet. Zerglings possess sickle
                limbs and sharp incisor teeth, used primarily for tearing into flesh. Further mutations may be made
                to zergling DNA, namely the alteration of their physiology through a metabolic boost to increase their
                reflexes and rate of movement and the mutation of their adrenal glands, changing their glandular balance
                to induce a battle frenzy. These adrenal glands have been observed to be unusually large for a
                creature of the zergling's size. Further analysis has revealed evidence of genetic manipulation, which
                also increased zergling aggression, driving them into a state of frenzy. In such a state, zerglings can
                bring down armored vehicles and structures with ease. Dominion marines have referred to such
                zerglings as "speedlings."

                Zergling SC2 Game4
                A zergling during the Second Great War

                The rapid genesis modification to zergling cells allows their gestation to proceed at remarkable
                speed. Zerglings have tough, adaptable, leathery skin which prevents moisture loss, while still
                allowing fluid circulation to keep the zergling's body temperature at appropriate levels. As per their
                origins, zerglings have an efficient nutrient storage system. Zerglings can derive the necessary
                compounds for life (even water) from anything they eat. This allows zerglings to operate away from a
                hive cluster for extended periods of time. The nervous system of zerglings is hyperactive, so much so
                that those enslaved by the Cerberus Program required two antennas per zergling to control their
                movement.

                Zergling Alternity Art1
                A zergling bursts out from the ground

                Zerglings are physically adaptable creatures, able to climb near vertical surfaces and are
                extraordinarily fast, though they are generally easy to exterminate, one ending up as roadkill after
                being run over by a recon vehicle. Zerglings have a complex optical structure, and their eyes
                have an optical aperture which allows them to see in the dark. This ability is further enhanced by a
                layer of tissue that reflects light, and the production of a substance which, depending on saturation
                levels, makes a zergling's eyes glow orange or red. This glow is an indicator that a zergling's vision
                has fully adapted to whatever low-light conditions it has found itself in. However, zergling eyes
                have also appeared as pure black in such conditions.

                A Leviathan Brood zergling

                The zergling's spiked tail allows the creature to maintain balance while running at high speeds. The
                spikes that extend from the tip have no discernable purpose, and Dominion scientists have speculated
                that it is vestigial from their dune runner forebears. By the Second Great War, some zerglings were
                observed to possess venational wings, which are used to increase ground acceleration. Spikes jut from
                the bodies of Leviathan Brood zerglings as a byproduct of their extremely simplified DNA. These spikes
                are retained even when Leviathan zerglings metamorphose into banelings.
